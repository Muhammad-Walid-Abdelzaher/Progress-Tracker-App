# Progress-Tracker-App
A Python-based application that combines Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with database (DB) management to help users track their Skill Development Progress.

- This is an app that combines OOP with DB.
- The idea of the app is to work like a REAL app.
- Its functionality is to create an object from a class (OOP) and connect that object to the database (DB).

Some of the Features:-
The user will have some functionalities like:

- Show Skills
- Add a Skill
- Update a Skill
- Delete a Skill
- OR EVEN Delete the Entire Account

Technical Notes:-

- There is error handling in most user inputs.
- The code structure is clear.
- The user inputs are user-friendly and are obvious.
- The functions work exactly as they should work.

Areas for Improvement:-
There are some fields that need to be improved like:

- It is better to connect to the database in each function when needed instead of connecting to the database globally, which may cause some errors if trying to improve the app code in the future.
- The user only has limited navigation when the app is running. For instance, if the user chose to "Show Skills" and then wanted to make another choice, the user will have to run the app again.
- The passwords are stored in plain text, and not hashed or encrypted.

Future Plans:-

I am still learning and I am planning in the future to improve the app more and more like:

- Not connect to the database globally; instead, calling it when needed.
- Improve the code structure to make it more efficient, like giving the user more availability to navigate the app within the same app running.
- Add more colors to the outputs coming from the app, like the show skills methods (how to show the skills, what colors, what text font, what size, and so on).

And other improvements...
